Dear Executive,

On the global calendar, is the Tourism Indaba, One of the largest African tourism marketing events. This is a four day trade event which attracts well over 13,000 delegates from the travel and tourism related industries with local and international traders and the media worldwide.
We will be holding meetings at the Indaba for anyone that has had clients travel to South African in the past and currently, or if it is a new travel destination which you would like to explore. Come, let’s discuss your options on how we can partner in this new venture into the future.   
We will represent #Cape Town as a preferred destination. Having provided more than 10 years’ service in the industry and equipped with experienced tour guides, we provide exclusive taylor-made tour packages in and around the Cape Area and as well tourism marketing activities, in Africa. Be it for travellers on business, tourist or holiday makers. Excellence and exclusive services is what we aim to offer the tourist and business travellers. It is important to recognize that we do not intend to just take you on sightseeing excursions, but also to ensure that you experience and appreciate nature through informative briefings.
Cape Town’s #Table Mountain is one of the seven natural Wonders of the World, of which we take our guest to amongst which we also do tours of the following: Garden Route, Township Tours, Whale watching, Wine Route Tours, Peninsula Tour, City, Robben Island, Table Mountain, Safari Game Drives and The Best of The Cape.
            
Attending this conference will help you keep up with new trends in the industry and adding value to your clients travel itinerary, whilst giving us the opportunity to make new connections with prospective clients.
